features to be added:
- on app.js, get logged in users session (with getMe() resolver) and make it available globally with zustand.
- notification feature by adding a graphql subscription. => basically whenever someone either likes or comments on someone's blog post, give them a notification (with the help of subscription) that someone liked/commented on your post.
